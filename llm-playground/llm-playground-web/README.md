Chat-Based Stories with LLM
This project enables you to create chat-based interactive stories powered by a Large Language Model (LLM). Follow the steps below to set up the development environment.

Prerequisites
Ensure Node.js is installed on your machine.
Download and install it from https://nodejs.org/en.
Setup Instructions

1. Install Dependencies
   Using your terminal, follow these steps:

Navigate to the ./server directory:

bash
Copy code
cd server
npm install
Ensure the node_modules folder is created after running the command.

Navigate to the ./client directory:

bash
Copy code
cd ../client
npm install 2. Configure Environment Variables
Ensure both the client and server directories have a .env file with the following parameters:

client/.env
env
Copy code
VITE_SERVER_URL="http://localhost:8080"
server/.env
env
Copy code
PORT=8080
OPENAI_API_KEY="your_private_api_key"
OPENAI_API_URL="https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions"
OPENAI_API_MODEL="gpt-4o"
Replace your_private_api_key with your actual OpenAI API key.

3. Run the Application
   Open two terminal windowsâ€”one for the server and one for the client.

In the first terminal, navigate to the server folder and start the server:

bash
Copy code
cd server
npm run dev
You should see this message:
Open stories server is running and listening on port 8080

In the second terminal, navigate to the client folder and start the client:

bash
Copy code
cd client
npm run dev
The client will start using Vite (a tool for developing web apps).
Open your browser and visit http://localhost:5173/ to access the client UI.

Notes
If you encounter any issues, ensure your .env files are correctly configured and all dependencies are installed.
This project requires a stable internet connection for accessing the OpenAI API.
