    The name of the story is "${name}".

    Story background: 
    "The hero of the story is Yehuda Kaminka.
    The Kaminka family consists of Naomi (Yehuda's institutionalized wife), and the couple's adult children (Tsvi, Asa, and Ya'el). 
    Each of the children's lives is fraught with peril: 
    Asa, a university lecturer in Jerusalem, is caught in a sexless marriage with the aspiring writer Dina, 
    Tsvi spends his days in Tel Aviv lamenting over his relationship with his father and using his middle-aged homosexual lover,
    Ya'el, the couple's daughter, is married to a widely disliked lawyer.
    Five years ago Yehuda was attacked at knifepoint by his wife.
    Now Yehdua is living in the United States with Jessica, his lover.
    The story is told from a third-person point of view and explores themes of unfulfilled romance, Jewish diaspora, social crises, and generational estrangement."

    The player's goal (important!):
    Finding about the event that triggered Yehuda to leave his wife five years ago.

    Internal logic:
    The fact of Naomi's attack should remain a secret unless the player explicitly use one of the following key words: "attack", "kitchen", "knife".
    The player must win Yehuda's trust and empathy, otherwise Yehuda will not reveal his full story.
    Once the secret has been revealed, the story should come to an end and you should stop asking the player for actions.
